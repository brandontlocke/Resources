##[StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
* Great for telling linear, spatial stories
* Google Account is needed (MSU email may not work)
* You may also do *Gigapixel*, which annotates an image (including historical maps)
* You can watch this [quick video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-C64JO7lMg)
* To embed the iframe in Wordpress you'll need to use the iframe shortcode plugin

##[TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)
* Great for telling linear, chronological stories
* Google Account is needed (MSU email may not work)
* You can watch this [quick video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUVUjt7jd1c)
* Media that you're using must be hosted somewhere. You can upload an image to the Wordpress and then grab the direct image URL from your media library
* To embed the iframe in Wordpress you'll need to use the iframe shortcode plugin
* Can use images from anywhere, video from Youtube and Vimeo, Google Maps, and social media. [They don't supply a list, but it's probably the same as TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/media-types.html).

###Common TimelineJS problems
* Timeline not appearing or some events are skipped
  * The spreadsheet is not **published** [see bottom of TimelineJS site for instructions](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)
  * Spreadsheet headers have been changed
  * Dates are not entered chronologically
  * Dates are formatted incorrectly
* Media isn't appearing
  * For images, make sure the link is to the image (the URL ends in a filename like *.jpg*)
  * The video host you're using is not supported

##Wordpress Fundamentals
* To log in, go to *yoururl.leadr.msu.edu/admin*
* Set up a static home page
* Make sure you're creating pages, not posts
* Change the theme by going to Appearance -> Themes
  * Most themes will have a *Customize* button for fine-tuning
  * You probably don't want to use themes we've customized *Divi Child, Divi for Foodways, mh-admin-theme, skt-full-width-little-egypt*
* Pages are automatically added to the menu - if you want to make one page drop down from another, select a parent page on the right side of the page you want to drop down
  * You can also create a custom menu and click and drag pages however you'd like
* If you Google "wordress [your problem]" you can find 10 solutions to most anything. Try to make sure the solution is from the past year or two and that it's about wordpress.org or 'self-hosted' Wordpress as opposed to wordpress.com
