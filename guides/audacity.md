## Editing Audio in Audacity
Audacity is an accessible, open-source, multi-track audio recording and editing software with a number of important features and effects, particularly for preparing podcasts. If you are interested in features or functions not mentioned in this brief introduction, please see the [Audacity Manual](http://manual.audacityteam.org/) for more tutorials or assistance. You may also check out our guide on [microphones](https://leadr-msu.github.io/guides/microphones.html) to see how we record audio using LEADR equipment.

**SETUP**: To  get started, you’ll need to download the Audacity app. First, head over to their site. Downloads are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you are going to be recording audio with audacity, you’ll want to plug your microphone into the USB port before opening audacity. If Audacity is not registering the mic, quit the app and try again. You may also need to select the drop down menu next to the microphone icon (1) and select your preferred mic.

**RECORDING & IMPORTING**: Once your mic is selected, you can begin recording. Start by pressing the record button (2). You will see the time in the bottom right corner start (3) and the sound waves will begin to appear in the editing pane (4). Good audio files have more full, longer waves. If the sound is too low, the waves will be smaller and shorter. To add another audio into audacity, you’ll need to go to File > Import > Audio. Audacity supports both WAV and MP3 files.

**EDITING**: There are a number of effects in Audacity, but two of the most useful are fade in and fade out. These can be used to blend two audio tracks together in a seamless manner. In order to do this, you’ll need to:
* Move one track so the two are aligned in a way that the use of a fade out/in makes sense. Select one of the audio tracks and then click the spot where in the timeline (5) you would like that track to be moved. In the menu bar, press Tracks >Align Tracks > Start To Cursor/Selection Start.
* Once your tracks are aligned, you can add in your effects. For fade outs, you only want to select the last 5 seconds or so the audio track. The opposite is true of fade ins, you’ll want to select the first 5 seconds or so. By holding your cursors down in the editing pane, scroll to select the amount of time you would like to add the effect to. To add the effect, select Effects in the menu bar > Fade In/Fade Out.

**SAVING & EXPORTING**: To export your file, go to File > Export Audio. You’ll want to select a WAV file type if you still plan on editing the audio some more. If your work is completely done, you can save it as an MP3. You should also fill in the metadata information for at least the artist and track name. This information will always stay with the MP3 file and can be useful when looking for information on it later.

**OTHER KEY POINTS:**
* Editing cannot be done while the tracks are playing, you’ll need to stop them completely to edit.
* If your mic doesn’t show up, go to System Preferences > Sound > Input > Stereo Mic. (For Macs)
* When recording, make sure to give yourself enough time on both ends. You can edit out any extra material later.
* When you first import a track into Audacity, it’ll give you the option to make a copy of the file or to work on the original. It is strongly suggested that you make a copy of whatever file you are importing. If you work on an original and make an undesirable change, the actual original cannot be retrieved later.

<!-- Seems like out of date advice, no actual URLs included either.

**ADVANCED OPTIONS:**
* Audio can also be recorded directly from your device without actually importing files into audacity. Skype interviews and audio from YouTube videos can be added into audacity this way. For a tutorial on how to do this with a Windows 10 operating system, watch this quick 5-minute video. To do this on a Mac, watch this tutorial. You will need to download a free program called Soundflower, which will allow you to reroute your internal audio to Audacity.
