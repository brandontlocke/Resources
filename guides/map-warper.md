## Overview
This guide will provide steps on how to georectify an image of a map so that the coordinates on the image of the map will line up with their real life coordinates using a web mapping service called [Map Warper](https://mapwarper.net/). You can then use your georectified map in many different types of applications. For this guide, we will then show you how to display this map in the Omeka mapping plugin: Neatline. If you are new to Omeka and Neatline, check out our other guides on [Omeka](https://leadr-msu.github.io/omeka/) and [Neatline](https://leadr-msu.github.io/neatline/) to learn more about those tools.

## Georectifying a Map
Georectifying a map image means taking points on the image of a map and lining them up with coordinates using some kind of mapping software. There are multiple ways to georectify a map, including using GIS, but we will be using a straightforward online mapping service at https://mapwarper.net/. Map Warper is a private project created by Tim Waters. Please consider deleting old maps that you are no longer planning on using to save server space for all of the individuals using this excellent tool.

### Using mapwarper.net
To start using mapwarper.net, you will need an account and an image of a map. Once you have your image, follow these instructions:
1. Create a mapwarper.net account by clicking the Create an Account button at the top-right of the page or by going to this link: https://mapwarper.net/u/sign_up
  * Or sign into your account if you already have one
2. Once you have an account, go to your homepage, and click the Upload Map button to upload your map image into mapwarper.net.
3. Fill out a Title, description, and any other available metadata for your map
4. Click the Create button to create a page for your new map
5. Next click the Rectify tab at the top of the mapâ€™s page to begin rectifying the map to OpenStreetMap.
6. Find the corresponding location of your historic map on OpenStreetMap by zooming, scrolling and double clicking on both of the maps.
  * *Note*: you can also map a fictional map to OpenStreetMaps, which will allow you to overlay a fantasy map onto your Neatline Exhibit. In this case, it does not matter too much where you georectify your fictional map to, as long as you know where to find it.
7. Georectify the map image by clicking the control point button in the top-right of the map. Your mouse cursor will turn into a map pop-up icon. Click this icon on a spot on your map image, and click the corresponding spot in the OpenStreetMaps map.
8. Once you have the two corresponding points lined up as perfectly as possible, click the Add Control Point button in between and below the two maps.
9. Repeat
