## Overview
In this handout, you will learn about the Dublin Core metadata scheme. Metadata is data about a data -in this case it is information about the digital items used in Omeka. This will help visitors to your [Omeka exhibit](https://leadr-msu.github.io/guides/omeka-items-and-exhibits.html) understand the origins of the Items used as the centerpieces of your exhibit by allowing you to properly document and categorize your digital content. This will enable others to follow your research as well as acknowledging the ownership and origins of the items.

## What is Metadata in Omeka?
In Omeka, [Items](https://leadr-msu.github.io/guides/omeka-items-and-exhibits.html) are the digital representations of resources used on the platform. Each historical artifact you use (such as a letter, photograph, painting, or newspaper article) should be an Item in your exhibit. You will provide information about these resources in Omeka using the [Dublin Core metadata scheme.](https://dublincore.org/) Dublin Core is a set series of 16 categories that allows for consistent information about items to be carried across a variety of platforms and uses.

Items are usually(but not always) digital representations of physical Items. The item can be used to represent either an image itself or something depicted by the item. For example, a painting of George Washington can be used as a digital item to represent the painting itself or to represent George Washington as the historical figure.

It is important to note that you are not always expected to be able to complete every entry for metadata. The importance of Omeka metadata is to properly cite where you obtained your research sources and develop an understanding of how items and data are referenced in digital archives. The goal is to fill out the information to the best of your ability.
