*Last Updated: 9/30/2021*

## Overview
Other LEADR resources have gone over [Exhibits](https://leadr-msu.github.io/omeka/) and [Items](https://leadr-msu.github.io/omeka/) in Omeka. A small part of those resources was dedicated to creating pages in Omeka. This guide will go into more detail on how to create and design those Pages. And because it is so important, we emphasize here that you must save your work anytime you make changes to your Exhibits or Pages. Omeka will not automatically save your work for you, and any unsaved work will be lost.

## Navigating to Pages
In order to begin creating and editing Pages, you will have to navigate to your Exhibit. Follow these steps:
1. Press the *Exhibits* tab from your Omeka website's dashboard.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
2. Find your Exhibit on the *Browse Exhibits* page and select the **Edit** button
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
3. This will take you to your Exhibit’s *Exhibit Metadata* page which provides the data for your cover page. __At the bottom of this page__, you will find the *Pages* section where you will see any Pages you have created as well as the **Add Page** button. You can get to any Page by pressing on that Page’s title.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>

## Adding, Deleting, and Moving Pages

#### *Adding*
* From the *Exhibit Metadata* page, you may add an additional Page to your exhibit by pressing the **Add Page** button.
* Alternatively, you may add a Page from the Page you are currently working on by pressing the **Save and Add Page** button. This will save the work for the current Page, and bring you to a new blank Page.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>

#### *Deleting*
1. From the Pages section of the *Exhibit Metadata* Page, press the **x** next to the Page that you want to delete.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
2. Once you press the **x** button, you will have to press the **Save Changes** button at the top right of the page to successfully delete your page. You may mark multiple pages for deletion, then press the **Save Changes** button. <img src="img/tags/TAGS_2.png" width="90%">

#### *Moving*
* You may shift and move your pages around by selecting and holding the Page you want to move, and dragging it to the location you want

## Editing Pages
Once you’ve begun adding pages to your exhibit, you can begin building and editing. There are three main components to making a Page: the title, content blocks, and saving.

#### *Page Titles*
* In the Page Title field, you can enter the title you would like for your page. Users will be able to see your page’s title from your Exhibit’s main page, so you’ll want a title that clearly describes what this page is about.
* You may also enter a custom slug in the next Page Slug field. This will be what shows up at the end of your website’s url when you navigate to this page. If left blank, the url for the example page title below would end in /example-page-title.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>

#### *Content Blocks*
Content Blocks are how you will upload items to your exhibit, provide textual analysis and organize your page. There are multiple types of blocks that allow you a lot of creative freedom when developing your pages. Remember to save your progress as you work!

###### *Block Types*
There are 4 Block types you can add to your Page
* **File with Text**: Allows you to add an Item or multiple Items and text. Your Item will be justified to the left or right side of the Page with your text wrapped around it.
* **Gallery**: Allows you to display your Items in a gallery of rows and columns.
* **Text**: Embeds any text you enter into your Page.
* **File**: Allows you to embed Items directly into your Page without any text wrapping to the left or right.

###### *Adding and Organizing Blocks*
* You may add any content block by __selecting the type of Content Block you want__ to add from the *Select Layout* Section and pressing the **Add new Content** button.
<br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
* The order of the Content Blocks will be the same order on the public website. You may reorganize and move content blocks around by clicking the header of the content block you want to move, and dragging it to the place you want it.

###### *Adding Content to your Block*
There are 4 types of Blocks you can embed into a page, but there are only two types of data that Blocks can use: Items and text.
* **Items**: *File with Text*, *Gallery*, and *File* Content Blocks all allow you to add items as content.
  * click the large **Add Item** button
  <br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
  * This will bring you to the Attach an Item pop-up where you can search for and select the item you wish to attach. Clicking on the **Show Search Form** button will allow you to search for an item by user and other categories.
  * Once you have found your Item, click on it and press the Select Item button. <br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
  * This will bring you to a captioning page where you can provide a caption to help describe the item or explain why you are using it here. Once you have finished, press the **Apply** button at the bottom-right corner of the pop-up.
  * Your Item should appear inside of your Content Block. You may add more Items.
* **Text**: *File with Text*, *Gallery*, and *Text* Content Blocks all allow you to add text as content. Keep in mind that Adding text into the File with Text and Gallery blocks will change how your items are displayed within the page. So it is always a good idea to check out how your page looks to the public by pressing the View Public Page button. To add text to a block follow this steps:
  * Enter your text into the text block within your Content Block. <br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>
  * Save your work by pressing the **Save Changes** button.

### *Saving*
When editing your pages, it is vital that you save your work. Any data or changes entered into Omeka will not save or take place unless you press one of the **Save Changes** buttons at the top-right corner of the page. <br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>

## Page Design

### *Viewing your Public Page*
It is a good idea to frequently visit the public website for your page by clicking the **View Public Page** button at the top-right of the page. This will let you see how things are coming together as you build your Exhibit.

### *Layout Options*
You’ll notice that different Content Block types and the order in which they are put will affect the layout and flow of your webpage. Another factor which will greatly affect how your page looks are the Layout Options located at the bottom of each Content Block. These options vary with each Block type and provide a substantial amount of creative freedom for designing your pages. <br><img style="border:1px solid black" class="center" src="img/tags/TAGS_1.png" width="80%"><br>

## Assessment
After using this resource, you should have a more advanced knowledge of how to create, edit and design pages for your digital exhibit. You should know how to upload Items and provide context using text in your pages.





- In the 9th row of TAGS, you may enter search terms.
  - You may enter any search term into the search box, and any tweets containing that search term will appear.
  - You may scrape all tweets for a particular hashtag by typing in “#yoursearchterm”
  - You may scrape tweets from particular people or tweets sent to particular people using their username in the following formats: “from:username”; or “to:username” <img src="img/tags/TAGS_9.png" width="90%">
- Alternatively, you may scrape favorited tweets or statuses instead of tweets by using the advanced settings (see next section).

#### *Advanced Settings for Your Search*
There are several advanced setting options in row 13 to 17 of your TAGS sheet. These functions are summarized below:
- Period: This period allows you to specify how far back into the past you want to scrape tweets for (up to 7 days). Note that your search will automatically search 7 days into the past if left blank.
- Follower Count Filter: You may use this option to specify particular users who have a minimum number of followers.
- Number of Tweets: If you want to collect Tweets for a longer period of time, then you can increase this number. Experience has shown that TAGS usually meets the limit in less than a month if this is not changed.  
- Type: This specifies whether you want to use search terms to scrape tweets or if you want to scrap the favorite tweets or statuses of a particular user.

#### *Scrapping Tweets*
Once you have your search terms and settings in place, follow these steps to scrape Twitter for Tweets:
- Go to the TAGS tab and select either "Run Now!" Or "Update Archive every Hour".
  - If you want a one time dataset, select Run Now!
  - If you want to continually take data, say in preparation for some event, select Update Archive every Hour.
    - Twitter only allows you to scrape Tweets from the past 7 days. So, if you want to analyze tweets for an extended period of time, you will have to do some planning.
    - For instance, if you want to analyze tweets before and after a political event, you could set up TAGS to scrape tweets beforehand. But, be sure to keep an eye on whether or not your TAGS sheet has reached your tweet limit before the event is over. <img src="img/tags/TAGS_10.png" width="90%">
- After running TAGS, tweets that meet your criteria will be found in the Archive tab at the bottom of your Google Sheet. <img src="img/tags/TAGS_11.png" width="90%">

## Downloading Your Data
Once you’ve scrapped some tweets, TAGS will provide you with a Google Sheet containing the actual Tweets, their creator, creation date and other metadata in the Archives section. Follow these steps to download your data:
1. Go to the file tab
2. Select download
3. Choose the format that you want to download your data in and click on it.
  - Excel and .csv formats will work well in Voyant. <img src="img/tags/TAGS_12.png" width="90%">

## FAQ
*How does TAGS work?*
- TAGS works by making requests for tweets (that meet your criteria) to Twitter’s Application Program InterfaceI (API). The API essentially acts as an administrator who decides whether or not to give you the Tweets that you are asking for. This means that Twitter is policing which tweets are sent to you.

*How does Twitter’s API affect my dataset?*
- There are many conditions that the Twitter API will run your request through before getting you your dataset. It is important that you consider how your dataset is made before making analyses. The following two conditions are significant in this regard:
  - The Twitter API will automatically prefer Tweets from more popular and connected users.
  - Twitter only lets you scrape Tweets within the last 6-9 days.

*If TAGS and Twitter give me a curated dataset, why are we using them?*
- While it’s true you are not getting a perfect dataset, that was never a possibility. Certain populations do not use social media and it is up to you to take all these factors into account when explaining your analysis. That being said, TAGS does provide a way to collect HUGE amounts of data from people publicly giving their opinion on issues. Using this data responsibly and correctly is extremely valuable.

*How do I use this data?*
- There are as many purposes for your data as you can imagine. You can examine the actual tweets users have submitted it, where they are from, how the tweets changed over time and so on.
There are numerous resources for learning how to visualize data including Voyant, Excel, R, Python, and Flourish. Voyant is a good option and LEADR  provides a handout.

*How do I collect useful data?*
- Much of this will be trial and error. Different search terms, hashtags and users will all greatly affect what your dataset looks like. Try to think critically about what issue you are looking into and how best to examine it with TAGS.

*My TAGS is not working or I did not get any results and want to do a new search. How do I reset?*
- The easiest way to reset TAGS is to simply create a new sheet. You may have multiple instances of TAGS running, and setting up a new sheet is much easier once you have already gone through the process.

## Assessment
By the end of this tutorial, you should have TAGS and be able to scrape for tweets in a variety of ways. This should provide you tabulated datasets that can be very large. Visualizing this data will be the next step in your analysis.

Keep in mind that how you got the data, and how you choose to visualize it will greatly affect your analysis. There are a number of ways to visualize data, but one way to analyze and visualize the textual data of TAGS is through Voyant. Check out the LEADR tutorial on this subject to learn more.
