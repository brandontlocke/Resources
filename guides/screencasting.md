## Overview
Screencasts are essentially a digital recording of computer screen output which often incorporates audio narration, images, video, and other media.

Screencasts are useful for educational, training, marketing, and other demonstration purposes, and are often utilized by teachers of online courses, software demonstrators, or lecturers and presenters interested in widening the base of their audience.

## Screencasting Software and Hardware

LEADR’s camcorders are Canon Vixia HF 620 and Sony HXR-nx30u. Both are handicams/compact camcorders, and both have image stabilization built in. (These are about eight years old, so the companies probably have newer models). Most students get camcorders for “consumer” use (rather than “professional” equipment). Canon and Sony are both popular, usable brands.

Good Places to shop online and compare are:
* Adorama - https://www.adorama.com/
* B and H - https://www.bhphotovideo.com/
* Amazon - Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/

Sometimes these places sell used equipment as well. Look at bundled kits that have accessories (and that show the compatible accessories such as extra batteries, chargers, or tripods).

## Considerations:
Decide on a reasonable price range.
Determine what features are absolutely necessary, and which are just useful.
* Do you need HD video, or an LCD Screen?
What kind of set-up will there be? Will you be shooting indoors or outdoors? Does the camcorder allow you to use it with an extension cord or only batteries?
* This will affect the quality of camera, microphone and lighting you will need
Make sure your microphone(s) work with that particular camcorder model.
* I often buy a kit for this reason – the built-in microphone alone is often lacking
DSLR cameras for still photos will also record video (but only about 30 mins at a time).
Would a large, professional camcorder make the interviewees nervous?

## Tips
* Have a spare battery and SD Card at all times.
* Bring the tripod that fits the cameral well.
* Some people record a back-up on their phone and/or use a phone to take some still photos.
* Keep a copy of the user manual PDF handy (on your phone or laptop).
