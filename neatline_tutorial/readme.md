##What can you do with Neatline?
[Neatline](http://neatline.org/) is an exhibit-buiding framework that makes it possible to create beautiful, complex maps and connect them with timelines. Neatline is built as a suite of plugins for the Omeka, a digital archive-building framework that supplies a powerful platform for content management and web publication.

Neatline is great for developing spatial and temporal narratives to illustrate how events unfolded over time and space.

###Examples
The developers of Neatline have a list of [Neatline Demos](http://neatline.org/demos/) you can explore.
##Getting started with Neatline
You'll need to speak with a LEADR staff member to get you set up with a Neatline installation. We'll need to know your email address and the short project title you'd like to use in the URL. It should be specific but concise.

Because Neatline is a plugin for Omeka, you'll be doing work in both the Omeka and Neatline interfaces. 
###Setting up an Exhibit
