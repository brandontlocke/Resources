##What can you do with Neatline?
[Neatline](http://neatline.org/) is an exhibit-buiding framework that makes it possible to create beautiful, complex maps and connect them with timelines. Neatline is built as a suite of plugins for the Omeka, a digital archive-building framework that supplies a powerful platform for content management and web publication.

Neatline is great for developing spatial and temporal narratives to illustrate how events unfolded over time and space. This tutorial is intended for individuals interested in developing a Neatline-only project - if you are interested in developing a digital collection with Neatline integration, make sure to see our guide on [Omeka](/omeka) as well.

The developers of Neatline have a list of additional [Neatline Demos](http://neatline.org/demos/) you can explore.
##Getting started with Neatline
You'll need to speak with a LEADR staff member to get you set up with a Neatline installation. We'll need to know your email address and the short project title you'd like to use in the URL. It should be specific but concise.

Because Neatline is a plugin for Omeka, you'll be doing work in both the Omeka and Neatline interfaces. 
###Setting up an Exhibit
1. Log in to your Omeka account 
1. Click on 'Plugins' at the top and then click Activate for 'Neatline', 'Neatline Features', 'Neatline Widget - Text', 'Neatline Time', and 'Neatline Widget - Waypoints'. You may not use all of these features, but it doesn't hurt to have them enabled. If these plugins aren't listed, contact LEADR staff.
2. After all of these are enabled, there should be a 'Neatline' link on the left-hand side of the screen. Click on that to enter the Neatline editing dashboard.
3. Click 'Create an Exhibit' and fill out the form.
    - Title
    - URL Slug
    - Narrative
    - Widgets
    - Public (checkbox at the bottom)
    - For all of the rest, we'll leave them as they are - you may need to come back to them at some point.
4. Click 'Save Exhibit' to generate your new Omeka exhibit.
