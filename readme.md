# LEADR Online Tutorials and Resources
https://leadr-msu.github.io

This is a collection of resources and tutorials created by [LEADR](https://leadr.msu.edu) staff for students. We teach lots of students how to use technology to research and tell stories, and it helps to make our modules and best practices available to everyone on the web. These guides were primarily created by graduate research assistants during their tenure at LEADR. Many of these guides were held in their own repositories, but have been coalesced into the guides folder of this repository.
